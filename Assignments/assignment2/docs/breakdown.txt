IMPORTANT NOTE:
We have spoken with Abbas during our project group meeting with him and he has agreed 
that we can work in a group for 3 for this assignment 2-3 provided that we also do 
both views for the assignment.


Breakdown of Work:

The team has decided that the best way to break up the work will to split the role into three roles:
model view and controller roles.  Everyone will also provide help as needed on any of the three roles.

Team Member: Logan Corey
Role: Front-end developer (View).  Logan will be working on the frontend portion of Assignment 2 and interacting
with the backend to ensure that the data is presented cleanly to the user.  This also means that he will be in charge
of UX/UI design. 


Team Member: Reynold Jong
Role: Database Developer (Model).  Reynold will be in charge of designing the schema for the databases and determining
what data to store in the databases.  He will also be creating functions to interact with the database.  Reynold 
will be working closely with the Google Maps api to ensure that plot markers are represented correctly in the database.


Team Member: Chris
Role: Crawler (Controller).  Chris will be taking on the role of developing the crawler which will be capable of
scrapping information from Kijiji given a seed and a limit.  He will be using Reynold's database functions to store 
the data.
